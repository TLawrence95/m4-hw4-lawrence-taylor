        <h2 id="About">About</h2>
        <article>
            <p>Ansel Adams was an American photographer who was arguably one of the most important landscape photographer of the 20th century. 
            He is also perhaps the most widely known and beloved photographer in the history of the United States; the popularity of his work has only increased since his death. 
            Adams’s most important work was devoted to what was or appeared to be the country’s remaining fragments of untouched wilderness, especially in national parks and other protected areas of the American West.
            He was also a vigorous and outspoken leader of the conservation movement.</p>

            <h3>Early Life and Works</h3>
            <p>Adams was a hopeless, rebellious student, but, once his father bowed to the inevitable and removed him from school at age 12, he proved a remarkable autodidact.
            He became a serious and ambitious musician who was considered by qualified judges (including the musicologist and composer Henry Cowell) to be a highly gifted pianist.
            After he received his first camera in 1916, Adams also proved to be a talented photographer.
            Throughout the 1920s, when he worked as the custodian of the Sierra Club’s lodge in Yosemite National Park, he created impressive landscape photographs.
            During this period he formed a powerful attachment—verging on devotion—to Yosemite Valley and to the High Sierra that guarded the valley on the east.
            It might be said that the most powerful and original work throughout his career came from the effort to discover an adequate visual expression for his near-mystical youthful experience of the Sierra.
            While photography and the piano shared his attention during his early adulthood, by about 1930 Adams decided to devote his life to photography. 
            (As late as 1945, however, he still thought enough of his playing to have a recording made of his interpretations of Beethoven, Chopin, and perhaps others.) 
            In 1930 he met the American photographer Paul Strand and was shown the negatives that Strand was then making in New Mexico. 
            Adams was deeply impressed with the simplicity of the images’ conception and by their rich and luminous tonality, a style in contrast to the soft-focus Pictorialism still in vogue among many contemporary photographers. 
            The experience confirmed in him his evolution toward a purer and more realistic style. In 1932 Adams helped form Group f.64, a loose and short-lived association of West Coast photographers (including Edward Weston and Imogen Cunningham) who favoured sharp focus and the use of the entire photographic gray scale, from black to white, and who shunned any effects borrowed from traditional fine arts such as painting.</p>
            
            <h3>Maturity</h3>
            <p>By 1935 Adams was famous in the photographic community, largely on the strength of a series of articles written for the popular photography press, especially Camera Craft. 
                These articles were primarily technical in nature, and they brought a new clarity and rigour to the practical problems of photography. 
                It was probably these articles that encouraged Studio Publications (London) to commission Adams to create Making a Photograph (1935), a guide to photographic technique illustrated primarily with his own photographs. 
                This book was a remarkable success, partly because of the astonishing quality of its letterpress reproductions, which were printed separately from the text and tipped into the book page. 
                These reproductions were so good that they were often mistaken for original (chemical) prints.</p>
